# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

*This project is insecure by design, since its goal is to assist with
teaching security concepts: such as cross-site scripting (XSS)
and SQL injection vulnerabilities.*

If you have any suggestions, feel free to open up an issue on GitHub:
https://github.com/hayesall/bottle-breaker/issues

Vulnerabilities will probably not be fixed, but suggestions may
be incorporated if they are interesting (e.g.: something that
still involves making cross-site scripting possible, but slightly
more difficult to exploit).
